I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple UI client that supports RESTful Post, Get, Put and Delete commands.

I'm using my [Flask API Tool ](https://github.com/BrianHammond/Flask_API_Tool) as a test since it's easy to understand.

Click on run.bat to run the program, the bat file will install pyside6, qdarkstyle and requests if they are not already installed on your system and start the application.

UI created in Qt Designer
